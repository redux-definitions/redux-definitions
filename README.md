**TLDR**

Automatically create standard reducers, actions, and selectors by describing your core application state using a library of [reducer definitions](#reducer-definitions). _The 14 lines of code below replaces 500+ lines of typical Redux code_
```sh
yarn add redux-enterprise
```
```js
import { createReducers, Definitions } from 'redux-enterprise'
const { Collection, Flag, Field, Index } = Definitions

const { actions, reducers, selectors } = createReducers({
  todoList: {
    todos: Collection,
    completedIds: Index,
    selectedIds: Index,
  },
  todoEditor: {
    isEditing: Flag,
    editingId: Field
  }
})

## Overview
Inspired by lessons learned building enterprise UIs, Redux Enterprise is a library that **abstracts common Redux reducer patterns into a library of definitions** that can be used to describe and automatically create completely standardized actions, reducers, and selectors.

### Whats the mission?
To help organizations scale development, maintainability, and velocity on Redux-based projects.

> Redux Enterprise is 100% compatible with any existing Redux-based project.

### Whats included?
- Library of reusable reducer definitions (Flag, Field, Collection, Index, etc)
- Standard way to describe, name, scope, update, and derive application state
- In-browser Redux-REPL for interacting with running application

## Get up and running in 5 minutes!

### Install the package
```sh
yarn add redux-enterprise
```

### Model your state
Use Redux Enterprise's reducer definitions to model your reducers. Definitions can be nested to provide logical grouping and scope. Create a new file (eg: `reducers.js`) and paste the code below into your project. 

```js
import { createReducers, Definitions } from 'redux-enterprise'
const { Collection, Flag, Field, Index } = Definitions

const { reducers } = createReducers({
  todoList: {
    todos: Collection,
    completedIds: Index,
    selectedIds: Index,
  },
  todoEditor: {
    isEditing: Flag,
    editingId: Field
  }
})
// `reducers` contains two reducers:
// { todoList: fn, todoEditor: fn }

export { reducers }
```

### Add the new reducers
Import the `reducers` from the call to `createReducers` and add them into your `combineReducers` call.
```js
import { reducers } from './reducers.js'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  existingReducer,
  anotherReducer,
  ...reducers // <-- add them
})
```

### Setup the REPL with your store
Right after your call to Redux's `createStore` start the Redux Enterprise REPL:
```js
import { startRepl } from 'redux-enterprise'

...

const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState, applyMiddleware(..))

startRepl(store)
```
> Note: when server-side rendering this call will be a no-op.

### All done! Try things in your browser console

# Concepts

## createReducers
As shown above your core application state is described using a library of [reducer definitions](#reducer-definitions). `createReducers` takes these definitions and creates reducers for you with corresponding actions and selectors. Definitions can be nested to provide logical grouping and scope.
```js
import { createReducers, Definitions } from 'redux-enterprise'
const { Collection, Flag, Field, Index } = Definitions

const { actions, reducers, selectors } = createReducers({
  todoList: {
    todos: Collection,
    completedIds: Index,
    selectedIds: Index
  },
  todoEditor: {
    isEditing: Flag,
    editingId: Field
  }
})
```
> Each top-level key in the `createReducers` schema generates a separate reducer.

## Actions
Standardized [FSA](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action) `actions` are returned from `createReducers` calls. The reducer definition determines what actions are available. For example a `Collection` has actions `create`, `upsert`, `remove`, `set`, `reset`, `clear`. Learn more about what actions are available and what their expected payloads look like the [reducer definitions](#reducer-definitions) section.

```js
const { todoList, todoEditor } = actions

todoList.todos.create({ id: '1', message: 'Do thee laundry' })
// { type: 'todos/create', payload: { id: '1', message: 'Do thee laundry' } }

todosList.todos.update({ id: '1', message: 'Do the laundry' })
// { type: 'todos/update', payload: { id: '1', message: 'Do the laundry' } }

todoEditor.editingId.set('1')
// { type: 'todoEditor/editingId/set', payload: '1' }

todoList.todos.remove('1')
// { type: 'todos/remove', payload: '1' }

todoList.selectedIds.add('1')
// { type: 'selected/add', payload: '1' } }

todoList.selectedIds.clear()
// { type: 'selected/clear' }
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that these are action creators. The actions must be dispatched just like any other actions!

## Selectors
Selectors are also returned from `createReducers`. For example a `Collection` has `items`, `find`, and `ids`:
```js
const { todos, todoEditor, selected } = selectors

todos.items(state) // returns a collection of todos
todos.find(state, { id }) // returns a todo with matching `id`
todos.ids(state) // returns an array of ids
```
> These selectors are perfect for feeding into [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)

## Redux-REPL
When in dev-mode Redux Enterprise automatically provides a REPL-like experience in the browser console for dispatching pre-bound actions and selectors. Actions and selectors from all `createReducers` calls are available in the REPL.

<img  width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redux-enterprise/redux-enterprise/typescript/images/repl.gif" />

> For your convenience unlike normal actions and selectors, calls to actions and selectors in the browser console are pre-bound to `store.dispatch` and `store.getState`. Remember, only in the console!

To setup the REPL, import `startRepl` and call it on your project's `store` object.
```js
import { startRepl } from 'redux-enterprise'

...

const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState, applyMiddleware(..))

startRepl(store)
```

## InitialState
All reducer definitions accept `initialState` values.
```js
import { createReducers, Definitions } from 'redux-enterprise'
const { Collection, Flag, Field } = Definitions

const { reducers } = createReducers({
  todoList: {
    todos: Collection({
	  initialState: [{ id: '1', message: 'Do the laundry' }]
    })
  },
  todoEditor: {
    isEditing: Flag({
	  initialState: true
	}),
    editingId: Field({
      initialState: 'fooId'
    })
  }
})
```

# Reducer Definitions
Redux Enterprise provides an assortment of reducer definitions that can be found by importing the `Definitions` object. Reducer definitions aim to be low-level enough to be generic but high level enough to abstract state patterns common to all applications.

## Collection
Collection creates a reducer that stores `Entities`. `Entities` are objects with `id` properties. Entities can take any form as long as they at least have an id. 

`Id = string`
`Entity = { id: Id }`

### Actions
`set(payload: Entity[])`
Takes an array of entities. Resets entire Collection to the payload of entities.

`reset(void)` 
Resets the entire Collection to empty state.

`create(payload: Entity)` 
Takes an Entity and adds it to the collection. Warning will be logged if an entity with the `id` already exists.

`update(payload: Entity)`
Takes an Entity and updates it in the collection. Entity is not added unless an entity with the `id` already exist.

`upsert(payload: Entity)`
Takes an Entity and updates it in the collection. The entity will be added if an entity with the `id` does not exist.

`remove(payload: Id|Id[])`
Takes an Id and removes any existing entity with the `id`.

### Selectors
`all(state: {}): Entity[]`
Returns array of entities.

`ids(state: {}): Id[]`
Returns array of ids.

`find(state: {}, params: { id: Id }): Entity`
Returns entity that matches id parameter.

`count(state: {}) => number`
Returns the number of entities in the collection.

`get(state: {}) => Normalized`
Returns the full underlying data structure which takes the form: `{ ids, entities }` where `ids` is an array of unique `id` keys and `entities` is an `id`-based lookup map.of ids and entities.

## Field
Field creates a simple reducer that stores any value and comes with action types that set and clear.

### Actions
`set(payload: any)`
Takes a value and sets it.

`clear(void)`
Clears any currently set value.

### Selectors
`get(state: {}): any`
Returns the value.

`isSet(state: {}): boolean`
Returns a boolean specifying whether a value is set.

## Flag
Flag creates a reducer that stores a boolean value and comes with actions for setting and toggling.

### Actions
`set(payload?: boolean)`
Sets value to true or optional payload's boolean value.

`unset(void)`
Sets value to false.

`toggle(void)`
Toggles current value.

### Selectors
`get(state: {}): boolean`
Returns the current boolean value.

## Index
Index creates a reducer that stores a unique set of ids. Ids can be added, removed, and toggled. An Index is perfect for 

`Id = string`

### Actions
`set(payload: Id[])`
Takes an array of identifiers. Resets entire Index to the payload.

`reset(void)`
Resets entire Index to empty.

`toggle(payload: Id)`
Takes an identifier and toggles its presence in the Index.

`add(payload: Id|Id[])`
Takes an identifier(s) and ensures its presence in the Index.

`remove(payload: Id|Id[])`
Takes an identifier(s) and ensures its removal from the Index.

### Selectors
`get(state: {}): Ids[]`
Returns the entire Index array.

`includes(state: {}, { id: Id }): boolean`
Takes id parameter and checks whether the identifier is present in the Index, returns boolean value.

`count(state: {}) => number`
Returns the number of Ids in the Index.

## Custom Reducer Definitions
Create new reducer definitions with the `createDefinition` function. The resulting object is a valid definition that can be used.
```js
import { createDefinition } from 'redux-enterprise'

const SpecialField = createDefinition({
  defaultState: 'morty',
  reducers: {
    set: (state, { payload }) => payload,
    clear: () => undefined,
  },
  selectors: {
    get: (state) => state
  }
})

export { SpecialField }
```

### Usage
```js
import { createReducers } from 'redux-enterprise'
import { SpecialField } from './specialField'

const { reducers } = createReducers({
  people: {
	rick: SpecialField
  }
})
```

# Appendix

## Typescript
Redux Enterprise is written in TypeScript. Due to the generative nature of the library fully typed actions, reducers, and selectors have proven difficult to implement. The goal is to get to the point where all actions and reducers have fully typed payloads ‚ú® Contributions from anyone with ideas on how to achieve this are very appreciated! Feel free to open a Github [issue](https://github.com/redux-enterprise/redux-enterprise/issues/new) or start a conversation on [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/redux-enterprise) with any thoughts or ideas.
